    abstractNote = {Charge-coupled devices (CCD's) have been fabricated on high-resistivity silicon. The resistivity, on the order of 10,000 {Omega}-cm, allows for depletion depths of several hundred microns. Fully-depleted, back-illuminated operation is achieved by the application of a bias voltage to a ohmic contact on the wafer back side consisting of a thin in-situ doped polycrystalline silicon layer capped by indium tin oxide and silicon dioxide. This thin contact allows for good short wavelength response, while the relatively large depleted thickness results in good near-infrared response.},

    ABSTRACT = {The performance of an analytical peak-shape function for fitting peaks in alpha-particle spectra has been examined using carefully measured spectra of 234U, 241Am and plutonium. The function used consists of the convolution of a Gaussian and a weighted sum of two left-sided exponentials. Peak fits using this function are performed on spectra from which a tail distribution has previously been subtracted.}
